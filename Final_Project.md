# Final Project: Applying Machine Learning Concepts using Scikit-learn

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to encourage students to apply the machine learning concepts learned in the course using the Scikit-learn library. Students will develop a machine learning model based on a dataset of their choice and demonstrate their understanding through practical application.

## Project Guidelines

### Step 1: Choose a Dataset
- Select a publicly available dataset that interests you. Good sources for datasets include:
  - Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  - UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
  - Google Dataset Search (https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)

### Step 2: Define the Problem
- Clearly define the problem you will solve with the chosen dataset (e.g., classification, regression).
- Describe the target variable you aim to predict.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- Load and explore the dataset. Use libraries such as pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Handle any missing values, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables as necessary.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Step 4: Model Selection
- Choose at least two different machine learning algorithms to train your model. Options include:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Random Forests
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Neural Networks
- Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

### Step 5: Training the Model
- Train each selected model using the training data.
- Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; mean squared error, RÂ² for regression).

### Step 6: Visualization
- Create visualizations to represent your data and model performance.
- Use libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn for creating graphs and plots.

### Step 7: Report Writing
- Write a comprehensive report that includes:
  - Introduction to the problem and dataset
  - Methodology of data preprocessing and model selection
  - Results from the model training, including visualizations
  - Conclusions and potential areas for future work
  
### Submission
- Submit your Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) or Python script (.py) containing your code along with your report as a PDF.
- Ensure your project is well-commented and easy to follow.
